# Implementation progress

## Beginner setup movie — 2026-10-19

- Added a consumer README video preview, linking the full reviewed MP4 and
  companion notes directly below it. Public assets are in docs/video/media/;
  publication is limited to tutorial documentation/media, leaving unrelated
  application commits local. Public link verification is pending.
- Completed an English Ubuntu/Linux tutorial with narration, captions, chapters
  and copyable consumer commands. Application sources and revision r48 are unchanged.
- Recorded genuine Bash/Chromium activity for the official Compose example in a
  separate project on ports 18080/13000. All recorded commands returned success;
  the container became healthy, scanned the public r40 installer PKG, extracted
  its icon and served working category JSON and the browser library.
- New terminal/browser recordings are distinct from existing real PS4 project
  screenshots and labeled r48 desktop UI close-ups. No live console capture feed
  is available; USB copying and GoldHEN installation are explained, not filmed.
  The official Docker install page is shown without reinstalling Docker on the
  recording host. GitHub's current public package is r40.
- Recorded the actual r48 desktop preview entering, testing and saving the live
  demonstration URL, using an isolated data mount. Its connection test found the
  scanned package. This is desktop evidence, not physical PS4 confirmation.
- Exported dist/tutorial/PS4-Games-Installer-Setup.mp4: 15:48.182, 1920x1080
  H.264/AAC stereo, 29 chapters, 94 burned-in caption cues and 29,833,765 bytes.
  SHA-256: 3cd75cfe133613e48a23f3ba089da3624da8fe5d9ef7676a713bfd0dd82f621f.
  The companion ZIP includes commands, transcript, captions, credits and provenance.
- Full video/audio decode, stream/chapter/caption checks and capture hashes passed.
  Reviewed chapter frames and corrected terminal overlays that obscured commands.
  Source scripts and provenance rules are in docs/video; large media/tool artifacts
  remain ignored. Stopped only the temporary Compose project and preview capture,
  retaining demonstration files. No package deployment or external publication.

## Internet Archive authenticated downloads — 2026-10-19

- r45 passes TLS on the user's PS4 9.00 but receives HTTP 401 for a package that
  also fails anonymous laptop requests. Browser-style headers, ordinary redirect
  cookie handling and removing Range do not change that response. The user then
  confirms the exact package downloads after signing into Archive.org.
- Add an Archive.org account screen and normal verified-HTTPS account login.
  Keep only login cookies in a separate private console file; password input is
  masked and cleared. The public JSON, saved settings, queue and backups contain
  no credentials. Existing diagnostics contain only bounded non-secret errors.
- Reuse the existing worker and staged package downloader. Both the package
  probe and full transfer receive the captured session; each redirect checks the
  destination before attaching it. Login requests never follow redirects.
- Failed login/session writes preserve prior state. Local sign-out removes the
  saved session; expired access requires signing in again. This addresses access,
  not Archive.org throughput. Actual console login/full installation remain pending.
- Full host/native suite and all 19 Python integrations pass. Focused native tests
  verify login method/body/length/encoding, no login redirects, bounded replies,
  cookie origin scoping, probe/full-transfer propagation and secret-free failures.
  Session tests cover parsing/injection, private file modes, corruption and deletion.
  App tests cover failed replacement/save, restart, busy-worker sign-out and
  credential exclusion from configuration/queue/logs. Final UI/App regressions pass.
- Desktop account/password/settings captures were inspected; passwords are masked.
  Native IME options compile but physical keyboard masking still needs verification.
  No user credentials were read, logged, added to public JSON or uploaded over FTP.
- Built and validated `dist/PS4Game_installer-r46.pkg` with the pinned toolchain.
  SHA-256: `1fc7ca5048e0b38330b3cf7bcdbd1d85b6d9ee2d6c996162f9f13cd30ca66480`.

## GoDaddy G2 compatibility anchor — 2026-10-19

- Retrieved the real r44 console log after the user installed and retried. Failure
  remains at archive.org before redirects: send=0x8095F00C, ssl=0x8095F00A,
  verify=0x20 (unknown CA), ca=121, ca_load=0, keepalive=1. This rules out the
  connection-mode change alone as a sufficient fix on this firmware 9.00 console.
- The live server supplies GoDaddy's G2 intermediate plus a cross-signed G2 root
  and legacy Class2 root. The bundled self-signed G2 root validates the current
  intermediate/leaf in desktop OpenSSL. Firmware path construction remains an
  inference; the device error does not expose its selected chain.
- Add only the official, pinned G2 issuing certificate as a compatibility anchor,
  as documented by SSPI for this chain. Keep the existing roots, keepalive and
  validation policy unchanged so this is one trust-input change for the next test.
  The anchor is not host-specific and avoids ancestor checks above this issuer;
  its root is already trusted, and its signature/CA constraints are verified.
- The extra asset loads before libjbc changes the filesystem root and remains
  alive with the other PEM records. Tests reject missing/multiple compatibility
  certificates. Native fixtures verify all three fixture records and metadata;
  they cannot reproduce firmware cryptography.
- Native HTTP regressions, both startup tests and all three certificate/package
  asset tests pass. The package builds and passes its hash/signature/import checks.
  r45 SHA-256: `13dba839a75b8a57876bedff4bf1e55515bf122a88f5dfcfd9005277c518a387`.
- Uploaded r45 using the existing FTP helper. The user installed it and retried
  the same package on PS4 9.00. Its actual log now reports Package HTTP 401 rather
  than the r44 unknown-CA error, confirming HTTPS passes for this request.
- A bounded desktop GET probe follows archive.org's HTTPS redirect to the download
  CDN and reproduces HTTP 401 Authorization Required. Another attempted file
  returns HTTP 500 there. These are upstream access/server responses; no package
  download or completed installation is established. No authentication was bypassed.
- This hardware A/B confirms the added compatibility anchor resolves the reported
  TLS rejection on firmware 9.00. It does not reveal the verifier's internal path
  selection algorithm or establish general PS4 11.00/BGFT acceptance.

## PS4 9.00 HTTPS compatibility follow-up — 2026-10-19

- User hardware evidence: r42 shows artwork but its package request still fails
  with `Send request (0x8095F00C)` on firmware 9.00. The generic installation-error
  sentence was misleading because it appeared before any successful transfer.
- Desktop TLS 1.2 handshakes verify the reported package host and CDN against the
  packaged roots. Both supply GoDaddy G2 with a cross-signed chain. This confirms
  desktop trust, not the console's chain-building behavior.
- SSPI documents that PS4's non-keepalive connection path can lose custom trust.
  Changed the connection flag to keepalive without changing roots or weakening
  verification. Request/connection/template cleanup remains per transfer/hop.
  This is a supported compatibility candidate; its effect on this console is
  unconfirmed. No intermediate anchors or certificate bypasses were added.
- A native fixture modeling the documented API behavior failed before the flag
  change with unknown CA. This is contract evidence, not hardware reproduction.
  Send failures now identify the hostname and redirect count without URL secrets.
  The dialog uses neutral text instead of claiming a package download occurred.
- Read the actual console app.log over user-provided FTP: r42 fetches 865 catalog
  entries, but multiple package-header probes fail with unknown CA before any
  download/install. Some CDN artwork reaches HTTP 500 after successful TLS;
  that host uses Let's Encrypt while the failing package origin uses GoDaddy G2.
- Added native SSL number/verification flags, errno, CA count/load result and
  keepalive mode to send-failure diagnostics through the existing App::log path.
  Getters run before abort/deletion and cannot replace the original failure.
  Private FTP data stays in ignored build/diagnostics and is not published.
- Focused native HTTP fixtures and real HTTP/TLS catalog/package integration
  tests passed. Generated the desktop captures and inspected the corrected error
  dialog; wrapping and buttons remain clear. No generated captures were committed.
- `make all` produced r44; `make validate` passed hashes/signatures and packed
  imports. SHA-256: `5f5d4a64b3a22792d13124b9dc7a167000404845d1a545ea5b122fe55127587b`.
  Uploaded this package to the console's package folder using the existing FTP
  deployment helper; installation/retry is pending user action.
- The upstream PR is a draft pending firmware 9.00 acceptance. The native fixture
  models a documented behavior; neither it nor desktop TLS tests prove this
  compatibility change resolves the console's actual handshake failure.

## HTTPS compatibility investigation — 2026-10-19

- A reported catalog/package request failed with `0x8095F00C` (unknown CA).
  The native client initialized SSL/HTTP without registering trust anchors and
  rejected all redirects. BGFT's independent trust store also makes remote HTTPS
  registration unsuitable for roots loaded only in this app.
- Original native HTTP, real HTTP integration and download tests passed on the
  unchanged r40 snapshot. New local download regressions failed before the fix:
  HTTP redirects and HTTP-to-HTTPS returned HTTP 302, and private-fixture HTTPS
  failed certificate verification. No external game package was downloaded.
- Added pinned Mozilla roots, bounded strict redirects, full-length HTTPS probes
  and reuse of the existing staging/local-install path. Cached CA assets load
  before the libjbc root transition; no later dependency on `/app0` remains.
- `make test` passed the complete host/native suite and 18 Python tests. Local TLS
  fixtures cover verified catalog/package downloads, HTTP-to-HTTPS upgrades,
  untrusted roots/hostname rejection, direct HTTP BGFT routing and HTTPS staging
  reuse. Native fixtures cover registration ABI/lifetime, cleanup/retry, prewarming
  across the root transition, bounded redirects and strict catalog/package TLS.
  Catalog/artwork requests preserve support for responses without Content-Length.
- `make all` produced r42, and `make validate` passed package hashes/signatures and
  packed imports. The package fingerprint matches revision.json and its manifest;
  SHA-256 is `64acdcf848170d51131592cbd9ec9353393db211bb2781ab9a9a1eca802e749c`.
- No physical PS4 is connected; hardware acceptance remains pending and the
  manifest explicitly keeps hardware_tested false. No console deployment occurred.
  Existing staging, leases and local installation were reused; no new service,
  runtime trust override, catalog schema or settings migration was added.

## r40 release notes — 2026-10-18

- Created the requested temporary realease_notes.md with consumer release
  highlights, changes/fixes since r34, requirements and upgrade guidance.
- Added an exact root ignore rule. The notes remain outside version control;
  only the ignore rule and work records are committed. Application/package
  inputs and successful revision remain r40.


## r40 screenshot shortcut in game Actions — 2026-10-18

- Added Show screenshots immediately after Details when images are supplied, for
  Installed and Available titles. The shortcut resets the gallery to image one.
- Added a media return screen so O returns directly to the originating Actions
  row. Screenshots/videos opened through Details still return to Details.
- Extended existing metadata/UI coverage for remote and installed/local
  variants, row order, first-image reset, wrapped image navigation, return paths
  and absent media. Targeted UI/metadata tests passed, including wrapped menus.
- `make all` built r40 and `make validate` passed hashes/signatures and packed
  launcher imports. Revision, source fingerprint, manifest and SHA-256 match;
  hardware_tested remains false.
- Generated all 97 desktop captures and inspected both Installed and Available
  Actions: Show screenshots follows Details, with readable rows and scrollbars.
  Added the shortcut to the consumer/expert manuals and an expert preview image.
- Recorded the successful revision and completed source/docs in a local commit.
  PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN shortcut acceptance remains pending; no deployment or push.


## r39 quicker selected-title scrolling — 2026-10-18

- User reports roughly five seconds before title scrolling becomes visible on PS4.
  Reduced the renderer's marquee pause from 1.25 to 0.35 seconds, retaining its
  speed and clipping. Updated the existing pixel regression to require visible
  movement by 0.9 seconds rather than four seconds.
- Targeted Docker artwork tests passed under ASan/UBSan, including visible motion
  by 0.9 seconds, clipping and static short text. Renderer animation tests passed.
- `make all` built r39 and `make validate` passed package hashes/signatures and
  packed launcher imports. Revision, source fingerprint, manifest and SHA-256
  match; hardware_tested remains false.
- Generated all 96 desktop captures and inspected the selected marquee at two
  times: text has moved by the first one-second capture and remains clipped to
  the tile. Refreshed the expert manual's scrolling illustration.
- Recorded the successful revision and completed change in a local commit.
  Perceived delay on PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN remains pending user acceptance.


## r38 screenshot download recovery — 2026-10-18

- Retrieved r37 logs, catalog and artwork listing through read-only FTP. The app
  restarted and refreshed 101 packages successfully. No screenshot cache files
  exist for the catalog's 648 images; covers come from the LAN while screenshots
  use images.igdb.com HTTPS. Four sampled CDN responses are valid 1920x1080 JPEGs.
- Existing artwork failures were swallowed, leaving the gallery's loading text
  unchanged. Kernel/app logs contain no underlying image failure code, so the
  exact console transfer failure is not proven by this evidence.
- Added bounded artwork errors/messages, visible gallery failure/retry instructions
  and app.log outcomes without image URLs. Isolated public IGDB image HTTPS
  compatibility using the pinned OpenOrbis sample callback ABI; other image
  origins and catalog/package requests retain the regular certificate policy.
- Added regressions for native HTTPS callback ABI/origin isolation, progressive
  JPEG decoding and asynchronous failure/retry recovery. The native/ASan checks
  pass. The complete Docker host suite passed, including App workflows/restarts,
  controller/HTTP integrations and all 15 Python tests.
- Native compilation/linking and packaging succeeded as
  `dist/PS4Game_installer-r38.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes). Package validation passed
  hashes/signatures and packed launcher imports; revision, fingerprint, manifest
  and SHA-256 match. Console screenshot acceptance remains pending.
- Generated 96 desktop captures with r38 and inspected both a loaded gallery image
  and a real refused-connection failure. Error text and retry/navigation controls
  fit the dialog. Updated consumer/expert/development manuals and preview images.
- Recorded the completed source, documentation and successful revision in a local
  commit. Console investigation was read-only; no deployment or push performed.
  Install r38 and retest screenshots on PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN to confirm whether the
  transport fix resolves the original failure; any remaining error is now visible.


## r37 label removal, clearer metadata and refresh/startup recovery — 2026-10-18

- Retrieved the PS4 app log, keyed/compatibility catalogs, session, personal data,
  queue and system ring log through read-only FTP. Snapshots stay under ignored
  build/refresh-crash-20261018. JSON is valid (101 packages, 80 IGDB objects).
- The app log ends after normal discovery/refresh messages, with no crash trace.
  The core-dump directory is empty; the system ring file has no usable text trace.
- Exact saved catalog/session/player replay passed under ASan/UBSan; no host
  memory violation appeared. Native stack-use review found no oversized worker
  buffers. GoldHEN's read-only Klog service supplied the actual worker SIGSEGV:
  runtime PC 0x511483 / ELF 0x111483 is the linked SDK memcpy.
- Preserved the matching r36 ELF and disassembly under ignored build/. The SDK
  realloc mmap fallback copies the old allocation size into a smaller replacement;
  the kernel registers match a large JSON shrink. cJSON's final output shrink
  exposes this path both when refreshing and reprinting cached IGDB objects.
- Routed all JSON output through buffered printing without the final shrink,
  preserving pinned dependencies and avoiding global allocator-hook changes.
  A regression rejecting large realloc shrinks reproduces ordinary-print failure;
  buffered catalog/personal-data round trips pass. Added startup/refresh phases to
  the app log. No console data/cache deletion or modification was necessary.
- Removed label fields, storage, editing, search and rendering. Legacy keys are
  ignored while preserving other records. Expanded category rows and added clipped
  scrolling text; Details separates Genres, assigned Tags, modes, players and split
  screen. Multiplayer flags describe multiplayer rather than solo play; player
  counts include the supplied co-op maximum when the general maximum is absent.
- Complete Docker `make -j4 test` passed: allocator-shrink regression, metadata,
  legacy personal records, menu flows, ASan/UBSan artwork/marquee bounds, native
  adapters, App workflows, HTTP integration and all 15 Python tests. Reused host
  model/UI objects avoid recompiling identical sources for each ordinary test.
- Native compilation/linking and `make all` built
  `dist/PS4Game_installer-r37.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes). `make validate` passed package
  hashes/signatures and packed launcher imports. Revision, source fingerprint,
  manifest and SHA-256 match; hardware_tested remains false. Existing native game
  launch flags and install/download behavior are unchanged.
- Generated all 95 desktop captures with the r37 label and inspected full-width
  categories, two scrolling positions, wrapped Genres, modes/player/split-screen
  rows and the three-field personal editor. Updated consumer/expert/development
  guidance and preview images; supplied console captures remain untouched.
- Recorded the completed source, documentation and successful revision in a local commit.
  PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN acceptance remains pending for restart with existing data,
  remote refresh and revised UI. No console writes, deployment or push performed.

## r36 rich game details and genre browsing — 2026-10-18

- Inspected the configured live catalog through read-only FTP/HTTP. Confirmed
  embedded `igdb` metadata and explicit game/update/dlc package types. Private
  review files remain under ignored build/, with no console writes.
- Implemented structured details, personal overrides, collapsed extra/technical
  sections, screenshot gallery/video links, package routing and remembered genres.
- Added cache, malformed-input, controller/session and native browser regressions.
  The saved live catalog round-trips 101 packages (96 games, 4 updates, 1 DLC),
  including 80 IGDB trees, 20 genres, 648 screenshots and 325 video links.
- Found and corrected the local installer's source-category-only update-slot check;
  it now shares package classification with the UI and saved queue. Native game
  launch flags remain unchanged. Added separate 1920-pixel gallery decoding with
  a shared 64 MiB / 48-image decoded-cache bound.
- Native OpenOrbis compilation/linking passed. `make all` built
  `dist/PS4Game_installer-r36.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes); `make validate` passed package
  hashes/signatures and packed launcher imports. Successful revision, current input
  fingerprint, artifact manifest and SHA-256 match; hardware_tested remains false.
- Complete Docker `make -j4 test` passed: metadata/cache/override/media/genre
  regressions, legacy models/sessions, native browser/installer/launcher/controller
  adapters, ASan/UBSan artwork bounds, App workflows, HTTP integrations and all
  15 Python tests. Controller expectations now cover row focus, wrapped selection
  and viewport following instead of the former text-only scroll behavior.
- Generated 92 desktop captures and reviewed ordered fields, personal/remote
  descriptions, collapsed/expanded technical sections, media screens, genre
  overflow and Updates/DLC badges. Regenerated the captures with the successful
  r36 label and re-inspected the details, genre sidebar and screenshot gallery.
- Updated consumer/expert/development guidance and preview illustrations. Readme
  console captures remain intact; temporary release_notes.md remains absent.
- PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN acceptance is pending for new details, full-size media,
  browser/provider playback, genre persistence and mixed-source add-on installs.
  Committed the completed implementation, documentation and successful revision
  locally. No deployment, console write, push or change to native game-launch flags.

## r35 catalog description immediately after Version — 2026-10-17

- User states the configured remote JSON now provides description and requests it
  directly after Version in Game Details.
- The existing parser, catalog cache and installed-title enrichment already carry
  this field. Moved its single nonempty row ahead of Package type, preserving the
  separate Local description and existing wrapped/scrollable rendering.
- Updated the expert catalog example and field explanation. No new provider/API,
  matching logic, settings or metadata-fetch path is required for this change.
- Existing Docker model regressions passed for settings, SFO, installed discovery
  and library behavior.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r35.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes).
  `make validate` passed package hashes/signatures and packed imports; input
  fingerprint, artifact manifest/checksum and successful revision record match.
- Generated all 84 desktop captures and inspected `08-details.png`: Version is
  immediately followed by Description, which wraps without clipping. Local notes
  remain separate and the remaining fields continue below with a scrollbar.
- Expert JSON examples parse and whitespace checks pass. Committed the source,
  documentation and successful revision locally. PS4 description display remains
  pending hardware acceptance; native launch/download/install code is unchanged.
  No console actions, deployment or push performed.

## README requirements and companion server — 2026-10-17

- User requested explicit jailbroken-PS4 wording and a recommendation for the
  specified companion server that generates the JSON game library.
- Updated the README introduction and setup section, linking the user's server
  repository and describing its JSON generation/hosting. Checked that description
  against the server's published README. The external project reference is
  intentional and explicitly requested; application identity and sources stay as-is.
- Checked Markdown/image references and whitespace; package inputs/revision remain
  r34. Documentation-only local commit; release_notes.md remains untracked and
  unchanged, with no deployment or push.

## r34 rollback of launch-prompt bypass — 2026-10-17

- User reports that r33 crashes the PS4 on game launch and explicitly requests
  reverting the application-close prompt change. Treat r33 as withdrawn.
- Restored `src/console.cpp` and `tests/launch_native_test.cpp` byte-for-byte from
  r32 commit `79c15fb`. The launch call again requests only SkipSystemUpdate (2),
  leaving PS4's normal application-close confirmation enabled.
- Keep the r32 verification/installed-launch fixes, r31 queue actions and all
  consumer/expert/development documentation and Screenshots/ captures. Corrected
  the manuals and acceptance tracker to reflect the rollback and console report.
- Native adapter tests can validate the parameters/error paths but did not detect
  r33's actual firmware behavior. Console launch acceptance remains explicit.
- Native launcher/uninstall regressions passed after rebuilding the restored
  adapter. App session/launch/history, r32 verification recovery and queue
  cancellation regressions also passed. Packaged input fingerprint matches r32
  exactly; no unrelated application changes are included.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r34.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes).
  `make validate` passed package hashes/signatures and packed launcher imports;
  source fingerprint, manifest checksum and revision record match.
- Corrected the expert/development manuals and checked local document references.
  Whitespace and tracked identity audits pass; local commit includes revision.json.
  No renderer/menu changes, console actions, deployment or push performed.
- User subsequently confirmed "now it works" after installing the rollback.
  Record r34 game launching as working and the reported r33 launch-crash scenario
  as resolved in this test, on the existing PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN session. No new
  native log was collected; saved-selection restoration and other feature checks
  remain separate.
- Updated acceptance documentation and committed the confirmation. This is a
  documentation-only update; application sources, artifact and revision remain r34.

## Consumer README and separate manuals — 2026-10-17

- User requested a shorter consumer README, separate expert/development manuals,
  and pictures from Screenshots/ displayed at about 30% width.
- README is now 114 lines / 746 words, down from 793 lines / 6,882 words. It covers
  the program, setup, controls, installation/launching, downloads, storage,
  organization and links to further help without implementation/revision history.
- Moved detailed consumer/configuration/recovery material into EXPERT.md, with a
  configuration-field reference and contents links. Moved build/deploy/preview
  instructions into DEVELOPMENT.md and documented testing, integration, release
  workflow and console acceptance limits.
- Inspected all 11 supplied console captures. Added them unchanged to version
  control and linked each README thumbnail to its full-size original in Screenshots/.
  Three pictures fit on each full gallery row using width=30% HTML in Markdown.
- Checked 56 local Markdown links/anchors across the three manuals; all resolve.
  JSON examples parse and gallery markup references every supplied image exactly
  once, with alt text, 30% width and matching full-size links.
- Source fingerprint still matches revision.json and the validated r33 artifact;
  its manifest/checksum also match. No app rebuild or revision increment is needed
  for this documentation-only change. Whitespace/identity audits and a local Git
  commit complete the change; no deployment or push performed.

## r33 game launch handoff without close confirmation — 2026-10-17

- User reports a PS4 dialog asking to close PS4 Games Installer when launching a
  game and requests a handoff without that confirmation.
- The current native adapter requests only SkipSystemUpdate (2). The pinned SDK
  defines SkipLaunch (1), also named SkipLaunchCheck in the original ABI research:
  https://github.com/OpenOrbis/OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain/blob/master/include/orbis/_types/sys_service.h
  https://github.com/LightningMods/PS4-daemon-writeup/blob/main/writeup.md
- Request SkipLaunch | SkipSystemUpdate (3), preserving the foreground user,
  initialization/packed imports, zero options, error propagation and saved session
  before the native call. This is intended to suppress the close confirmation;
  firmware behavior still needs console acceptance. No self-exit race or separate
  process termination was added, and installer/queue behavior is unchanged.
- Reviewed Itemzflow launch reference at commit
  `9126e4788eb8a9d9657b8096ec7e25eb3bc9ab8d` under ignored build/reference-review;
  no reference implementation was copied or added as a dependency.
- Rebuilt native launcher/uninstall tests against the pinned SDK; both passed,
  including the exact combined flags, user/init failures, native launch failure,
  retry and positive app-ID returns. Existing App session/launch/history, r32
  verification recovery and queue cancellation regressions passed.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r33.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes).
  `make validate` passed hashes/signatures and packed launcher import checks;
  source fingerprint, manifest checksum and revision record match.
- Updated consumer docs/changelog/TODO and committed the successful revision.
  Whitespace and tracked identity audits pass. No renderer/menu change or desktop
  dialog simulation; the PS4 confirmation cannot be validated through screenshots.
  Console acceptance is pending; no console actions, deployment or push performed.

## r32 installed base verification and launch recovery — 2026-10-17

- User reported a completed installation stuck in Verifying, blocking launch, then
  timing out to Failed Data 100%. Read-only FTP captured queue/tasks/log evidence in
  ignored `build/hardware-verification-20261016T211630Z/`.
- CUSA28188 Bonfire Peaks: catalog 01.23, native completion true, no owned tasks,
  all 794,165,248 bytes transferred. External installed SFO confirms title CUSA28188,
  APP_VER 01.00 and category gd. This is a current catalog/base version mismatch.
- Base verification now accepts native completion plus an exact Title ID from a
  fresh installed scan despite a catalog version difference. Missing titles still
  cannot confirm a base package; updates retain expected-version checks and
  vanished tasks retain the old-copy/version-advance checks.
- Recheck only verification-timeout failures with recorded native completion when
  fresh installed evidence proves success. Preserve actual service errors and
  unknown outcomes; do not submit another install or blindly relabel history.
- Released verification-only jobs no longer block Installed launch; packages still
  awaiting verification remain queued against duplicate installation. Tracked or
  active installation tasks continue blocking launch through the main button.
- A second read-only queue snapshot confirms the same record became stage 7
  (Failed), with native completion true and no task ID. Its exact timeout message
  matches the recovery predicate; genuine native errors remain separate.
- Native install/download sources and existing progress labels remain unchanged.
- Docker feature/UI/App regression suites passed, covering the hardware version
  pair, startup/restart persistence, existing timeout recovery without submission,
  missing title/unknown completion/real-error preservation, update-version guards,
  launch access and owned-task launch blocking. Existing cancellation tests passed.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r32.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes).
  `make validate` passed package hash/signature and packed import checks; source
  fingerprint, manifest checksum and revision record agree.
- Generated all 84 desktop captures. Visually inspected mismatched-version
  completion diagnostics, Installed tiles and pending verification diagnostics.
  Completion/version explanation and controls fit without clipping. Added the
  consumer version-mismatch example; README image links resolve.
- Console acceptance remains pending. No console task/file was modified; no
  deployment or push was performed. Documentation and the r32 revision are included
  in the local commit.

## r31 queue cancellation and reporting rollback — 2026-10-17

- User requested a working Cancel Task action and restoration of r28 reporting.
- The old diagnostics footer offered cancellation even for inactive history with
  no owned task, while its Triangle handler ignored that input. Triangle now opens
  cancellation for active/waiting/owned tasks, or removal for inactive history.
  Confirmation retains the original package URL even if queue indices change.
- History removal saves before mutating the visible queue, preserves installed
  games/local records/staged packages, and rejects active or newly tracked jobs.
- A completion poll may release a task while cancellation waits; clear the pending
  cancellation in that case so later history removal is not blocked.
- Reverted r30 native-completion overrides, Needs verification policy, historical
  failure migration and reporting labels. Temporary stage-10 files load into the
  original verifier. Native installation/download code remains identical to r28.
- Menu overflow indicators, wraparound and the three-entry sidebar are retained.
- Full Docker `make -j4 test` passed host/native-service suites and all 15 Python
  integrations, including cancel/retry, stable confirmation identity, inactive
  history removal, save-failure preservation and completion/cancel race recovery.
  Restored r28 verification expectations and historical-result preservation pass.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r31.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes).
  `make validate` passed package hashes/signatures and packed import checks; source
  fingerprint, manifest checksum and successful revision record match.
- Generated all 83 desktop captures. Visually reviewed active cancellation and
  inactive removal confirmations, failed/completed queue diagnostics and Options
  overflow. Labels, button icons and text fit; original Data/task reporting is back.
  Updated the consumer queue image and added both confirmation examples; README
  image links resolve. Whitespace and tracked-file identity audits pass.
- Console cancellation acceptance remains pending. No console tasks were modified
  and no deployment or push was performed during development.

## r28 retest and historical queue clarification — 2026-10-16

- User clarified that the Failed Data entries were historical and confirmed fresh
  r28 installs work perfectly. The prior trace does not establish a current r28
  reporting regression; the earlier diagnosis treated historical records too
  broadly. Keep the trace as historical evidence and r28 hardware acceptance.
- Compared r28 commit `d6a7414` with current HEAD: `src/install.cpp` and
  `src/download.cpp` have no differences. Download/staging, native registration,
  task start, failed-task recovery and cleanup code remain the tested r28 code.
- r30 does change queue policy: explicit native completion wins over library/
  catalog discrepancies, unknown timeouts become Needs verification, old timeout
  records migrate, and unverified items can be retried/rechecked. This is more
  than a label-only change and still needs console acceptance.
- Recommend one fresh install in r30, checking Completed, current installed-title
  presence/launch and persisted status after reopen, plus old-record migration.
  No need to repeat unrelated setup checks solely for this clarification.
- Corrected README/CHANGELOG/TODO and reviewed the diff with `git diff --check`.
  Documentation-only change; no application rebuild or revision increment.

## r30 menu overflow and installation result reporting — 2026-10-16

- User requested visible menu overflow, corrected successful-install queue status,
  and Downloads/Collections in Options. User also confirmed uninstall works on the
  previously confirmed PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN environment.
- Fresh read-only FTP evidence under ignored `build/hardware-queue-20261016T204119Z/`
  records completed native tasks for CUSA10606 and CUSA02537 (`system_completed`
  true, all transfer bytes received), stored as Failed after verification timeout.
  The user subsequently identified these as historical entries; they do not prove
  a current r28 regression. The log shows the installed count reaching 18, then successful uninstall and
  returning to 16. Their SFOs are no longer present; exact installed versions at
  completion cannot be established from this trace. An active direct transfer
  and a waiting job were also present; no console files/tasks were changed.
- Native completion now wins over catalog version estimates and stale/missing
  library metadata. Disappeared tasks without positive native completion retain
  independent title/version checks and become Needs verification after timeout;
  fresh scans can resolve them. Data completion alone cannot mark success.
- Added targeted migration of the old verification-timeout failures without
  modifying real service errors. Diagnostics distinguish completed/released task
  tracking, and completed rows omit obsolete transfer percentages.
- Removed Downloads/Collections sidebar entries, kept Options access and migrated
  old sidebar positions to the current library. Added shared pagination scrollbar
  thumbs and directional arrows, including the custom additional-source list.
- Targeted feature/App/Ui/maintenance suites passed. The final full Docker
  `make -j4 test` passed all host/native-service suites and 15 Python integrations,
  including migration persistence, native success with mismatched/missing library
  data, unverified late discovery, actual-error preservation and legacy sidebar
  migration. Existing native completion/failed-task recovery checks remain green.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r30.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes).
  `make validate` passed package hashes/signatures and packed imports; source
  fingerprint, manifest checksum and successful revision record match.
- Generated all 81 desktop captures at r30. Visually reviewed Options first/middle/
  last pages, additional sources first/last views, game details, native completion,
  unverified diagnostics at both scroll ends and the three-entry sidebar. Scrollbar
  thumbs/arrows and text fit the dialogs; completed/released status is clear.
- Refreshed all 16 existing consumer images and added the overflow-menu image;
  README image links resolve. Updated CHANGELOG/TODO and recorded uninstall as
  confirmed without closing its separate cancellation/history-preservation checks.
  Whitespace/identity audits pass. No console deployment or push was performed;
  new r30 behavior still needs console acceptance.

## r29 wraparound navigation — 2026-10-16

- User requested Up from the first menu entry to select the last, and Down from
  the last to select the first, throughout the application.
- Added shared bounded list navigation and applied it to all 22 selectable menu
  screens plus the sidebar. Additional sources start at row 1 to protect the
  primary source; the Add row participates in wrapping. Storage wraps both rows
  while retaining unavailable-drive installation checks.
- Summary lists wrap first/last. Tile rows wrap top/bottom while preserving the
  column when available and clamping to a short destination row. Left from the
  first tile column still reaches the sidebar; detail text and L2/R2 page jumps
  retain their existing boundaries.
- Added real-Ui regressions for every menu boundary/full cycle, singleton and
  empty/shrinking lists, source deletion/add-row protection, ragged tiles, sidebar
  return and confirmation guards. Native pad tests cover stick wrap in Options.
  Added six captures driven by actual boundary inputs for visual review.
- Targeted Ui/controller suites passed, then the full Docker `make -j4 test`
  passed all host/native-service suites and 15 Python integrations. Existing
  installer recovery regressions remain green. FTP test uploads used only their
  localhost fixture; no console deployment was performed.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r29.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes).
  `make validate` passed package hashes/signatures and packed imports; revision,
  source fingerprint and manifest checksum match the final package.
- Generated all 75 desktop captures at r29. Visually inspected the six new
  boundary-driven captures: Options last/first pages, Settings last page, Summary
  last entry, sidebar last entry and final tile row. Highlights, page changes,
  footer controls and selected artwork remain correct and readable.
- Updated consumer navigation instructions, CHANGELOG and TODO. Identity and
  whitespace audits pass. Console wraparound acceptance remains pending; no
  console deployment or remote push was made.

## r28 installation hardware confirmation — 2026-10-16

- User confirmed installation now works after r28, resolving the reported
  0x80990086 refusal and existing failed-task 0x80991404 case on the previously
  confirmed PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN environment.
- Updated README, CHANGELOG and installation acceptance checks. This is user
  confirmation, not a new FTP trace: no post-fix task log was retrieved, and
  task-ID transitions, active-task preservation, cleanup errors, task survival
  after application exit and storage destinations remain separate checks.
- Documentation-only update; reviewed the diff and ran `git diff --check`.
  No application change, package rebuild or revision increment was needed.

## r28 failed native-task recovery — 2026-10-16

- User reports the same exact-content task 268435469 / 0x80991404 still blocks
  installation with 0x80990086, and requested upstream installation research.
- Reviewed upstream C# direct-download/local-install call sites and the native
  bridge at commit `61b00ce423be9d7bdee3e6951962536269dd0b00`. Both local and web
  installs use the same native BGFT APIs already used here; upstream provides no
  failed-task recovery for 0x80990086. Its local generic-error return precedes the
  special duplicate notice, and other conflict branches uninstall the title.
  Kept installed titles intact rather than adopting that uninstall behavior.
- Added bounded recovery for a refused local registration: actual PKG identity and
  subtype must locate a task whose progress reports an error. Repeat the identity
  lookup and progress check immediately before unregistering; retry registration
  once using the retained file and application slot. Active/unknown tasks and
  remote-only identities cannot trigger cleanup. No console tasks were modified
  during implementation or reference research.
- Added native-service regressions for orphan recovery, both duplicate codes,
  active tasks, lookup/progress failures, identity changes/resumption, cleanup
  errors, repeated conflict, second-registration/start failure, retained new task
  ownership, update subtype/slot and refusal of remote-only cleanup.
- Full Docker `make -j4 test` passed all host/native-service suites and 15 Python
  integrations, including the new recovery cases. FTP deployment tests used only
  their localhost fixture; no package was deployed to the console.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r28.pkg`; `make validate` passed package
  hashes/signatures and packed imports. Source fingerprint, revision and manifest
  checksum match the final artifact. Source identity and whitespace audits pass.
- Updated consumer recovery instructions, CHANGELOG and TODO. This changes the
  installer backend only; no render/layout changes or new screenshots. PS4
  installation success and the new native recovery path remain unconfirmed.

## Installation refusal investigated from console logs — 2026-10-16

- Pulled current app log, queue/task journals, staging listing and targeted BGFT
  metadata over the configured private FTP connection, read-only. Evidence is
  ignored under `build/hardware-install-20261016T155942Z/`; no console files,
  tasks or installed titles were changed. Installed app revision is unconfirmed.
- The latest two Back to Bed (`CUSA02537`, catalog version `01.01`) attempts reuse
  the complete 245,760,000-byte staged package and fail during local BGFT
  registration with `0x80990086`. Exact Content ID lookup reports existing task
  `268435469` (`0x1000000D`), whose progress error is `0x80991404`.
- Queue contains one Failed entry without an owned task ID; `tasks.json` is empty.
  Preserve the complete package and do not automatically unregister that task.
  The 40 saved `/user/bgft/task/*/d0.pdb` records contain no matching Title ID;
  numeric suffix `0000000d` belongs to an unrelated disc title. No matching saved
  notification was found. The existing task's original URL/provenance is therefore
  unconfirmed; do not identify it solely by a directory-number suffix.
- Confirmed in source that the requested disk-first flow already exists: packages
  from the current non-Range server are saved under the application's `downloads`
  directory and handed to the native installer using `/user/data/...`. Repeating
  the download will not resolve the reported existing-task conflict.
- Next hardware check: cancel the failed Back to Bed entry through PS4
  Notifications > Downloads if present, then retry the retained local package.
  If no matching entry is visible, close the app, restart the console, enable
  GoldHEN and retry. Successful registration/installation remains unverified.
- Documentation-only update; reviewed evidence and source call flow, and ran
  `git diff --check`. No application changes, package build or revision increment.

## r27 faster browsing and named server profiles — 2026-10-16

- User requested suggestions 4 and 6: page/letter navigation, remembered searches,
  and named server profiles. Queue controls/backups/undo/badges are outside this change.
- Adding L2/R2 page controls, a letter picker, bounded persistent search history,
  profile source-set drafts and isolated caches with stale-fetch protection.

- Implemented page jumps, filtered-view letter counts/picker and 12 recent searches
  with deduplication, explicit clear/cancel and immediate session persistence.
- Added native digital L2/R2 and SDL trigger mapping, plus desktop Page Up/Down.
  Existing controller/IME suppression tests pass with both trigger bindings.
- Added 16 complete-source profiles in Settings, save-copy/rename/delete/use drafts,
  explicit Save/discard and shared local records/queue state. Legacy settings load.
- Added keyed source caches, legacy-cache adoption, immediate source-cache selection
  and rejection of stale catalog results. Old remote enrichment is cleared from
  installed entries when changing sources; owned transfers keep their saved URLs.
- Corrected misleading indentation in two new test loops before the full build.
  Generated 68 captures and inspected Search, Jump to letter, Profiles and page
  navigation. Native compilation/import checks pass. Corrected an invalid URL
  fixture in the new profile tests. The full host suite passed, including all 15
  Python integrations, native adapters, source-switch rollback, offline caches,
  session persistence and stale-fetch rejection.
- Final review added a one-time legacy-cache migration marker and an App regression
  for externally edited source URLs, preventing repeat adoption under a new server.
  The complete suite passed again after this fix, and r26 built/validated.
- Final page-boundary review found the nine-row letter picker skipped eight items.
  Matched its page stride to nine, added a regression and a second-page capture.
  Browsing/App/controller regressions passed after this correction; native compile
  and packed import validation passed. Inspected the corrected second-page capture.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r27.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes). `make validate` passes
  package signatures/hashes and packed imports; source fingerprint, manifest hash
  and revision match the final artifact. r26 was an intermediate build before the
  picker pagination correction; it was not deployed.
- Regenerated all 69 captures at r27, inspected profile selection, expanded Settings,
  page navigation and both letter pages, and refreshed the consumer images. Added
  README examples/screens for profiles, recent searches and the letter picker;
  all README image links resolve.
- CHANGELOG and TODO record implementation and validation. Identity/whitespace
  audits pass. New PS4 controller/profile acceptance remains unchecked in TODO;
  no console deployment or remote push was made.

## r25 navigation and maintenance improvements — 2026-10-16

- User authorized suggestions 1–6. Implementing sidebar shortcuts, sorting,
  Updates, dependency checks, storage cleanup and USB diagnostics. Package
  checksum verification (suggestion 7) is outside this requested change.
- Cleanup will require evidence that staging files are released; ambiguous legacy
  files and active tasks remain protected. Diagnostic export uses an allowlisted
  report rather than copying configuration, URLs, personal profiles or raw logs.

- Implemented contextual sidebar Downloads/Collections, Updates filtering/version
  labels and persistent sidebar/Updates state. Expanded sort fields/order with old
  setting migration and unknown values last; paginated the expanded Settings.
- Added enqueue/retry dependency guards, persisted queued-base links, independent
  eligible scheduling and a fresh installed scan before update/DLC transfer. Queued
  dependencies fail clearly when their base fails/cancels. Optional catalog base
  version requirements persist; firmware metadata remains advisory.
- Added measured artwork/staging/reclaimable/protected usage and confirmed cleanup.
  Explicit released/in-use lease files protect old/ambiguous packages after crashes;
  failed starts that cannot unregister now retain their owned task IDs.
- Added selected-field USB diagnostics, bounded operation/code summaries, omission
  of raw logs/URLs/personal fields, unique exports and USB readback. Source files and
  existing USB player backups remain independent of diagnostic exports.
- Initial OpenOrbis compile exposed unsupported C++ stream headers; replaced the
  log splitter with bounded string parsing. Host compilation also required a lambda
  directory deleter. Native compilation/import validation then passed.
- Initial feature/App integration tests passed, including missing-base, failed
  dependencies, stale UI vs fresh console state, cleanup and disconnected USB checks.
  Corrected two new test fixture setups before running the complete suite.
- Generated 60 desktop captures and inspected Updates, expanded Settings, blocked
  install requirements, cleanup and USB diagnostics. Adjusted singular file counts
  and removed lease implementation terminology from the consumer cleanup screen.
  The complete suite then passed (all C++ suites and 15 Python integrations),
  including HTTP lease release/protection cases. A second run also passed after
  the successful dependency-ordering test and explicit empty Updates screen.
- Final review fixed queued-package back navigation to Game packages, protected
  Failed state for a retained task whose start failed, and tolerated cache files
  disappearing during measurement. Added retained-task polling/cancellation and
  package back-navigation regressions. The complete suite passed again after these
  fixes, including all 15 Python integrations and the native adapter checks.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r25.pkg` (6,619,136 bytes). `make validate` passes
  package hashes/signatures and packed import checks; revision, source fingerprint
  and manifest SHA-256 match the final package.
- Regenerated all 61 desktop captures at r25. Inspected sidebar focus, Updates in
  summary/tiles, blocked and queued-base requirements, expanded Settings, cleanup,
  diagnostic export confirmation and empty Updates. Refreshed all consumer images
  and added Updates/cleanup/diagnostic captures; README image links resolve.
- README, CHANGELOG and TODO describe the six requested improvements, controls,
  migration, ownership protection, export omissions and remaining console checks.
  Identity/whitespace audits pass. No console deployment or remote push was made;
  r25 hardware acceptance remains explicitly unchecked in TODO.md.

## r24 background download stage refinement — 2026-10-16

- Recorded whether a PS4 task was registered for a remote background transfer
  or a staged local package. Background bytes below total now show Downloading;
  a local copy remains Installing. Phase changes and transfer mode persist.
- A completed stage cannot regress because a later progress sample lacks its
  completion fields. Added App checks for Downloading → Installing and saved mode.
- Full host suite passed, including all 15 Python integrations, native adapter
  checks and the App Downloading → Installing transition with durable transfer mode.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r24.pkg`; package hash/signature and packed-import
  validation passed. The source fingerprint and package SHA-256 match the manifest.
- Regenerated all 48 desktop captures, inspected the queue/verification/package
  screens and refreshed the README images to r24. Identity and whitespace audits
  pass. Console acceptance remains unchecked in TODO.md; no deployment or push.

## r23 library and installer improvements — 2026-10-16

- User authorized all seven suggested improvements. Implementing persistent queue
  and installation verification, bulk local organization, USB profile backups,
  saved collections, related package/version views and a source setup helper.
- Retaining the existing native installer and Title ID records; console end-to-end
  installation acceptance will remain unchecked until actual hardware evidence.
- Added `queue.json` with 200 bounded active/history items, restart recovery,
  transfer samples, retry/cancel and explicit stage diagnostics. The transfer and
  BGFT monitor use separate managed workers; native BGFT calls share a mutex.
  Cancellation stops/unregisters only recorded tasks, retains ownership/staging
  on service errors and never treats a failed service query as file release.
- Added fresh-scan installation verification and a two-minute unconfirmed failure.
  Existing installed copies cannot establish success for vanished tasks. Known
  updates require the requested version; DLC completion remains a system report,
  separate from individual add-on discovery and game tiles.
- Added bulk category/add/remove/clear-tag editing with unique Title ID selection,
  atomic all-or-nothing profile updates and retained drafts on failed writes.
- Added up to 64 named rule collections and built-in shortcuts. Personal profile
  schemas 1/2 still load; writes use schema 3. Saved filters retain removed names
  instead of silently broadening, and renames update their rules.
- Added ordinary USB profile export/readback and validated replacement restore,
  with a unique recovery copy of the original raw profile, including corrupt data.
  Game files, source settings, task ownership and queue state are excluded.
- Added base/update/DLC related-package views and Title ID grouping, numeric
  dotted-version comparison, installed/latest-version details and honest unknown
  DLC status. Catalog category remains the installer routing field.
- Added staged source setup with URL/format testing, type counts, missing ID
  warnings, empty-catalog reporting, HTML detection and source-specific errors.
- Full host suite passed, including all 15 Python integrations, native adapters,
  rollback/retry, queue verification/cancellation/restart, source validation,
  old-profile loading, saved rules and USB recovery tests. Native compilation and
  packed launcher import checks passed before final packaging.
- Full host suite also passed after the final USB-connection and stale-legacy-task
  checks. Generated 48 desktop captures; inspected bulk selection/editing, both
  saved-rule pages, queue diagnostics, USB restore confirmation, source results,
  package grouping and expanded Settings/Options. Added three README captures.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r23.pkg`; `make validate` passes hashes, signatures
  and packed launcher imports. Source fingerprint, manifest SHA-256 and revision
  match. Source identity and whitespace checks pass. No deployment or push.
- Further queue phase labeling refinement is tracked in the next revision.

BGFT cancellation reference:
https://github.com/flatz/ps4_remote_pkg_installer/blob/master/installer.c

## r22 quick category/tag assignment — 2026-10-16

- Added direct Assign category and Assign tags game actions in both libraries,
  reusing the local Title ID profile, name registries and PS4 keyboard.
- Category selection saves with X; tags toggle with X and save together with
  Square. O cancels the quick draft. Successful persistence returns to Actions;
  failed persistence leaves the picker and draft available for retry.
- Pickers focus the existing assignment or newly entered name. Added game name
  and Title ID context, explicit control hints, visible save errors and game
  action pagination so extra actions cannot overlap the controls.
- Full `make test` passes, including all 15 Python integrations and native adapter
  tests. New UI/App checks exercise both libraries, existing/new names, current
  selection focus, cancellation, category clearing, tag toggling, atomic-write
  failures/retries and preservation of notes, labels, ratings and launch history.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r22.pkg`; `make validate` passed package hashes,
  signatures and packed launcher imports. Package SHA-256, source fingerprint
  and revision 22 agree with the release manifest.
- Generated 32 desktop captures and visually inspected both quick pickers and
  both game action pages. Controls and menu rows fit their panels. Added the
  quick tag picker to the consumer README alongside the documented controls.
- Source identity and whitespace checks pass. New controls still require console
  acceptance; no deployment or Git push has been performed.

## r21 local game organization — 2026-10-16

- Added personal category, label, description and tags to the existing Title ID
  record, separate from catalog data and the package category used for install
  routing. Both Installed and Available receive the same saved personal fields.
- Added local name registries, including empty categories/tags, case-insensitive
  ASCII reuse, rename with assignment updates, and confirmed deletion that clears
  assignments while preserving all other records. Limits: 256 categories and 256
  tags, 16 tags per title, 64-byte names/labels and 2047-byte descriptions.
- Existing player schema 1 records load with default empty metadata. Writes use
  schema 2 so older releases reject and preserve the profile rather than erase
  new fields when updating ratings. Saves still use atomic replacement, validate
  before writing, preserve corrupt files and retain drafts on write failure.
- Added controller/IME editing, category/tag pickers and a local browser with
  creation, rename, delete confirmation, filtering and clear-filter actions.
  Added local-category/tag grouping and session filter/group restoration. Counts
  stay unique when one title appears in multiple tag groups.
- Tiles/summary always show category and label; selected descriptions preview
  above the footer. Details/search include the local fields. The native build
  compiled and launcher import validation passed.
- Full `make test` passes, including all 15 Python integrations. New checks cover
  legacy profiles, refresh isolation, shared Installed/Available records, name
  creation/rename/deletion, notes after uninstall/restart, failed-save draft
  retention, discard/cancel, tag-picker cursor clamping, multiline details,
  combined filters, multi-tag counts, group selection and session persistence.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r21.pkg`; `make validate` passes hashes, signatures
  and packed launcher imports. Verified the package SHA-256 and source fingerprint
  against the manifest/revision record. No failed build consumed a revision.
- Generated 29 r21 desktop captures and inspected the editor, tag picker,
  category/tag browser and both dashboard layouts. Refreshed README screenshots
  and documented editing, browsing, management, filtering and data limits.
- Source identity and whitespace checks pass. No deployment or Git push; the
  new console IME/controller flows and long descriptions remain explicit hardware
  checks in TODO.md. Existing native install behavior was retained this turn.

## r20 download versus installation — 2026-10-16

- Pulled current app log, saved catalog/config/task/player data, app.db, staging
  listing, PKG header and small BGFT task metadata through the configured FTP
  target. Read-only inspection; private evidence stays in ignored
  `build/hardware-r19/`. No downloads, installed titles or task files were changed.
- Reported title is Back to Bed, CUSA02537. The staging file is 245,760,000 bytes;
  PKG header declares the same size and its Content ID matches that title. The
  app log reaches full direct download, then reports Already queued. Its mapping
  corresponds to registration error `0x80990086`. `tasks.json` is empty and app.db
  has no matching title. This was a download followed by rejection, not a
  successful installation followed by a missing home-screen icon.
- Inspected saved BGFT task records: none contains that Title/Content ID. Do not
  infer which unrelated task to remove from a duplicate error alone; an in-memory
  service conflict remains possible. New diagnostics query the content-specific
  native lookup and preserve the raw rejection code. If no matching task can be
  confirmed, the dialog advises a full PS4 restart/GoldHEN and retry.
- Local registrations used the app's `/data/...` path. Corrected BGFT requests
  to the system-visible `/user/data/...` path, and read actual PKG identity/size
  from the file before registration. Catalog Title ID mismatches and malformed or
  truncated PKGs fail without submitting a task. This correction has compiled
  for PS4 but has not yet established successful installation on the console.
- The pinned SDK's stat layout reads allocation blocks as `st_size`; the retry
  cache check therefore rejected complete packages. Switched package length
  checks to descriptor seeking. Added a regression runner that deliberately
  reproduces the bad stat size, and native package tests including a sparse 5 GiB
  package. Existing complete staging files remain available for registration retry.
- Download status now says installation follows the download. Added persistent
  failure dialogs for registration and BGFT task errors, without interrupting an
  open keyboard/settings edit. Retry returns through install confirmation.
  Acknowledging an unchanged task error prevents repeated modal popups each poll.
- Full `make test` passes, including all 15 Python integrations. New coverage
  checks canonical storage paths, actual Content ID/size submission, truncated
  headers, Title ID mismatches, 64-bit package sizes, duplicate lookup without
  cancellation, cache reuse despite broken stat, refusal/retry, IME deferral and
  acknowledged-error suppression. One earlier host application wait timed out
  during a concurrent build; added call-site diagnostics, and five consecutive
  application runs plus the final full suite passed afterward.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r20.pkg`; `make validate` passes all hashes,
  signatures and packed launcher imports. Source fingerprint and package SHA-256
  match their records. Generated 23 r20 desktop captures and inspected the new
  failure dialog; refreshed the README dashboard image.
- Current source identity and whitespace audits pass. No deployment, task
  cancellation, game removal, console installation or Git push was performed.
  Hardware registration/installation and home-screen appearance remain pending;
  the new code does not establish that the console's conflict has cleared.

## r19 personal library and download investigation — 2026-10-16

- User confirmed r17 game launching, manipulator navigation and all installed
  titles work on PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN. Launching replaces this foreground app;
  position must be persisted before entering the native launcher. The working
  launch parameters and installed-title filtering are retained.
- Configured FTP target returned No route to host. Requested availability for a
  read-only log/dump pull; no new console evidence or console writes this turn.
  The exact download CE-34878-0 fault remains unconfirmed.
- Disassembled the pinned SDK's statvfs wrapper: it invokes statfs on a temporary
  buffer and never populates the caller's result. This explains the zeroed
  capacity display and staging-space failure. Read the stable kernel statfs
  prefix via `_fstatfs`, with oversized backing storage, checked 64-bit arithmetic
  and explicit full/unknown/read-only states. Native ABI/cleanup tests pass.
- Native HTTP used a 64 KiB automatic transfer buffer, consuming the documented
  small default worker stack before system-library call overhead. Moved transfer
  and catalog buffers to the heap; gave App and artwork workers explicit 512 KiB
  stacks. Native stack-attribute/ownership/error tests pass, and compilation now
  limits HTTP adapter frames to 8 KiB. This repairs a concrete hazard without
  claiming the unavailable crash dump proves its origin.
- Added atomic, validated local `player.json` (Title ID ratings/history/launch
  requests) and `session.json` (both library selections, search and sidebar).
  Corrupt player files are preserved; failed position saves prevent launch.
  Catalog refreshes cannot overwrite personal records. History records titles
  observed installed from this version onward, not unknown pre-existing history.
- Added a native uninstall boundary with valid-title, self/system protection,
  registration checks and readable service errors; its native mock tests pass.
  UI requires a separate confirmation and retains local records afterward.
- Added star rendering, Was installed badges and persistent current-library
  footer counts. Restored the exact r17 Canvas bubble implementation as requested.
- `make test` passes the full host suite and all 15 Python integrations, including
  native HTTP/BGFT/launcher/uninstall/storage, explicit worker stacks, sanitized
  native filesystem output, ratings/history isolation, session restore after
  reordering, failed launch-counter rollback, blocked position writes, corrupt
  player-file preservation, controller dialogs and uninstall cancellation.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r19.pkg`. `make validate` passes every package
  hash/signature and packed launcher import check. Verified the source fingerprint
  and package SHA-256 against the revision/manifest records; no failed build
  consumed a revision.
- Generated 22 desktop captures and inspected the r19 tile/summary libraries,
  rating dialog, Installed actions, uninstall confirmation and storage panel.
  Refreshed the README image. Renderer tests measure 105,741 moving pixels in
  Tiles and 99,764 in Summary with the restored subtle bubbles; paused frames
  remain identical and tile artwork is unchanged.
- FTP retry still returned No route to host. No deployment, console uninstall,
  live installation or Git push was performed. New console acceptance checks,
  especially download stability, real capacities and native uninstall, remain
  explicit in TODO.md. Source identity audit and `git diff --check` pass.

## r18 bubble visibility — 2026-10-16

- Investigated the reported missing dashboard animation. Existing bubbles used
  fill alpha 9/255 and one-pixel rims at 17/255; summary artwork and its dimmer
  further obscured them. The main loop already passes elapsed time each frame.
- Increased visible contrast, added soft highlights/rims and a faster upward
  drift. Cached six reusable bubble sprites to avoid per-pixel shading work each
  frame. Layer particles after the summary artwork/dimmer and before the controls.
- Kept the saved animation preference and the Settings draft preview. Added a
  full-renderer regression check for exposed-area motion/contrast in both layouts,
  unobscured tile artwork and identical paused frames, plus paired captures.
- `make test` passed the full host suite and all 15 Python cases. The new renderer
  check measured 41,256 exposed pixels moving in Tiles and 41,249 in Summary,
  with peak channel contrast 94 in both. Turning animation off produced identical
  frames; tile artwork stayed unchanged and the Settings draft preview paused.
- `make all` built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r18.pkg`; `make validate` passed package
  hashes/signatures and packed launcher imports. Package source fingerprint and
  SHA-256 manifest match. Generated 19 desktop captures, inspected the tile and
  summary motion pairs, and refreshed the README image from the new dashboard.
- Source identity audit and `git diff --check` passed. No console deployment or
  Git push; PS4 visibility/frame rate still require hardware retesting.

## r17 hardware-driven repairs — 2026-10-16

- Pulled r16 logs, saved settings/catalog/task tracking, installed-title SFOs and
  selected system-service export metadata through the configured FTP target.
  Read-only inspection: no console files, settings or downloads were changed.
  Private evidence remains under ignored `build/hardware-r16/`.
- The log reports repeated launcher `0x80020003`, BGFT `0x80991404`, only five
  installed titles, and an informational storage panel. The user separately
  confirmed that artwork downloads now work.
- Twelve hidden games have active `gp` metadata. A host replay of the actual SFO
  files now finds 17 game/homebrew candidates, including GTA V, Minecraft, DOOM
  and DIRT 5. Native registration checks remain in the console discovery path;
  this replay does not establish the final console count.
- Actual SystemService exports place LncUtil in a packed export library. Replaced
  default-library dlsym with linked LncUtil imports and checked the generated
  Orbis ELF's library/module pair for both initialization and launch.
- The live package endpoint serves a valid PKG with HTTP 200 even when a Range
  request asks for four bytes; HEAD probes also stall for most packages. The
  reference server ignores ranges and includes query strings in filesystem
  lookup. The exact BGFT request causing its 404 was not captured, so that
  particular URL transformation is not claimed as proven.
- Added a PKG probe and a streaming direct-download/local-BGFT fallback for
  servers without ranges, using private internal staging. A full 126,222,336-byte
  package from the live server was streamed to PC staging through the production
  host transfer code; length and PKG magic passed. No console task was submitted,
  and the temporary PC package was removed afterward.
- Added a real Internal / External USB selector using Application Install
  Location registry research, with availability checks, recognized-value checks,
  write/readback verification and rollback on mismatch. This changes the system
  default and does not interpret BGFT application slots as physical drives.
- `make test` passes: catalog/model/UI checks, sanitized artwork checks, native
  launcher/storage/BGFT/HTTP adapters, application state/persistence checks,
  controller tests, HTTP integration, and all 15 Python cases. New application
  checks preserve tracking/staging while copying or when unregister fails, allow
  retry after a failed owned task is retired, and release staging after confirmed
  installation. HTTP coverage includes ranges, ignored ranges, cache reuse, 404,
  HTML, cancellation, low space, missing length and truncated transfers.
- `make all` produced `dist/PS4Game_installer-r17.pkg`. `make validate` passed all
  package hashes/signatures and packed launcher import checks; the current source
  fingerprint matches revision 17. `make screenshots` generated 15 captures;
  inspected connected/disconnected storage, install confirmation and exit screens.
- Source identity audit and `git diff --check` pass. Updated README, changelog,
  tracker and attribution. Deployment tests used disposable localhost FTP servers;
  no package was uploaded to the console and no remote Git push was made. The new
  launch, storage selection and BGFT installation paths still need a PS4 retest.

## Repository migration

- Removed the old Git history, Unity project, original workflow, and obsolete files.
- Created a new `main` branch with origin `https://github.com/e1z0/PS4-Games-Installer.git`.
- Native code lives in `src/`; third-party notices and GPLv2 license are retained.
- Build tools run in Docker. The first new package revision will be r2.
- Hardware target: PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN. No console checks have been performed.

## Data and platform layer

- Added bounded SFO parsing and internal/external installed-title discovery with registration checks.
- Added settings migration, atomic saves, complete catalog metadata, offline serialization, grouping and matching.
- Added PS4 launch service integration, UTF-16 keyboard support and 64-bit BGFT task progress.
- Host catalog/HTTP, settings, library and SFO fixture tests pass.
- The shared dashboard and desktop renderer are now being compiled and visually checked.

## Dashboard and preview

- Added a shared state machine for menus, settings, dialogs, source editing and Circle exit.
- Added tile and summary layouts, all requested grouping choices, details and About screens.
- Added animated bubble background, cover loading/caching, and an original app icon.
- Desktop preview generated 12 screenshots; tiles, summary and settings were visually inspected.
- Controller flow tests pass. PS4 executable and initial package r2 compile and validate.
- Review changed the launch adapter to dynamic lookup; r14 below corrects the
  containing module after the console exposed a missing-file error.

## Console integration and reliability review

- Added dynamic lookup for launch and installed-title services after homebrew
  privilege setup; the launch module path is corrected in r14 below.
- Added UTF-8/UTF-16 keyboard conversion, readable startup failures and task ledger polling.
- Hardened artwork invalidation, settings schema validation and large-library grid caching.
- Package r3 built in Docker and passed all LibOrbisPkg hash/signature checks.
- A second unchanged `make` reused r3 without compiling or consuming a revision.
- Final host tests pass: catalog/HTTP, settings/SFO/installed fixtures, controller flows,
  50,000-entry navigation, Unicode/artwork and renderer bounds with ASan/UBSan.
- Four packaging integration tests pass: unchanged/changed/clean builds, failed builds,
  concurrent builds and changes to inputs during packaging.
- Final desktop captures include splash, both library views, Options, Settings, URL entry,
  details, About, exit confirmation, empty library and offline presentation.
- Hardware behavior remains unverified; console acceptance checks are recorded in TODO.md.

## Final checkout verification

- A fresh local clone of the committed repository built successfully using the Docker image.
- That checkout rebuilt r3, retained the identical input fingerprint/revision record, and
  remained clean in Git after building. Package validation passed in the clean checkout.
- Inspected the packaged file list: executable, font, new icon, platform stubs and license
  notices are present; Unity files and desktop sample covers are absent.
- Final splash, summary and About screenshots were inspected, and selected captures are
  committed under docs/images for consumer documentation.
- All software implementation items are complete. Hardware checks remain explicitly
  unchecked because this workspace has no PS4 test connection.

## FTP deployment

- Added `make deploy` with a private `.env` target; the existing local configuration
  is preserved and remains ignored. Added `.env.example` for new checkouts.
- Excluded environment files from the Docker build context. The deployment parser
  handles quoted values/comments without shell evaluation or credential logging.
- Deployment validates configuration before building, checks the current revision's
  fingerprint and SHA-256, then uploads through passive FTP with a temporary name,
  optional remote size verification and final rename. Failed transfers clean up
  their temporary file when the server remains reachable.
- `make test` passed all host suites and ten Python integration tests (six deployment
  cases and four packaging transactions). The deployment cases also pass with the
  host's older Python, including invalid encoding and stale/corrupt package checks.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r4.pkg`; `make validate` passed all package hash and
  signature checks. The deployment helper verified the real artifact and parsed the
  existing private target inside Docker without opening a network connection.
- The configured live target has not been contacted; FTP tests use a local socket
  server, including an invocation of the actual Makefile's deploy target.

## Installation storage request (partial implementation)

- Inspected OpenOrbis BGFT/AppInstUtil headers, flatz's published BGFT ABI, current
  homebrew installer sources and ps4libdoc's exported storage symbols. These do not
  establish a verified per-download Internal/External selection mechanism or the
  signature/semantics of a system installation-location setter. No guessed flag,
  application-slot-to-drive mapping, or registry write was added.
- Added a Settings storage information panel showing mounted, writable internal
  storage and PS4 Extended Storage with free space. Stale mount directories on the
  parent filesystem do not count as connected drives. Triangle refreshes the check.
- The panel preserves draft settings when returning with Circle and directs users
  to the PS4's Application Install Location setting for the actual selection.
- The requested in-app destination chooser remains incomplete and is tracked in
  TODO.md. Existing install behavior is retained; the UI does not claim to override
  the destination. No console connection or live deployment has been performed.
- Host tests passed, including stale/missing mount paths, a separate writable
  filesystem, storage refresh commands and preserving draft settings on Circle.
  All ten Python deployment/packaging tests also passed.
- Built and validated `dist/PS4Game_installer-r6.pkg` with all package hash/signature
  checks passing. r6 supersedes the intermediate r5 storage-panel build after the
  free-space display was corrected for a full drive.
- Generated fourteen desktop captures and visually inspected Settings plus both
  connected/disconnected USB states. Selected storage captures are in docs/images.

## Reported console startup failure — 2026-10-16

- User hardware report: initial splash rendered briefly, then the application
  displayed `Cannot open /app0/assets/icon.png` on its readable error screen.
- Extracted r6 and confirmed the packaged icon's SHA-256 matches the source. The startup order opened the font
  before privilege setup but opened the icon afterward. The pinned libjbc changes
  the process root/current/jail directory to the global root; `/app0` refers to the
  application's sandbox path before that transition.
- Moved icon loading before privilege setup and retained the bundled font bytes in
  memory for FreeType's lazy glyph reads. The renderer uses loaded artwork afterward.
- The splash minimum is now three seconds measured from its first presented frame,
  including initialization time. Early controller input is consumed without opening
  menus; initialization failures retain the splash until the same deadline.
- Added regressions using the real main/App/UI/renderer with test-only platform and
  video adapters. They remove asset-path access during privilege setup and check
  successful dashboard rendering plus failure-path timing.
- `make test` passed all native host suites (including artwork/font ASan/UBSan)
  and twelve Python integration tests. Both new startup regressions passed:
  the dashboard rendered after asset-path removal, and normal/error startup each
  kept the splash for at least three seconds.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r7.pkg`; `make validate` passed all package hash
  and signature checks. Generated fourteen desktop captures and visually inspected
  the splash and dashboard with the memory-backed font and preloaded icon.
- The corrected build has not been retested on a PS4 or deployed to the live target.

## Reported end-of-app CE-34878-0 — 2026-10-16

- User clarified that CE-34878-0 appeared at the end of the application. The error
  code alone does not identify the crashing instruction; no console crash dump is
  available. This is a candidate exit-path correction pending hardware validation.
- Both normal exit and closing the startup error screen previously returned from
  main through the C runtime. Inspected the linked runtime and native PS4 homebrew
  exit implementations. PS4 Cheats Manager and Itemzflow use the system service's
  `sceSystemServiceLoadExec("exit", ...)` request, with homebrew credentials restored.
- Extracted native lifecycle handling from the package installer. Startup saves
  original credentials; termination restores them after all application scopes,
  including worker joins and video/controller destruction, have completed.
- Native exit now loads SystemService and requests shell termination on every
  handled exit path. If the request returns, the main thread waits instead of
  falling through libc `_exit`; a rejected request is logged to stderr and the user
  can use the PS4's Close Application command.
- Added tests against the pinned SDK/libjbc declarations with fake native calls,
  covering successful exit, failed credential reading/preparation/application,
  failed restoration and a rejected exit request. Existing real-main regressions
  also check that normal/error shutdown reaches the exit hook after video cleanup.
- `make test` passed all host suites, including artwork/font ASan/UBSan and thirteen
  Python integration tests. The native lifecycle test exercised all six scenarios;
  real-main success/failure cases both reached termination after video cleanup.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r8.pkg`; `make validate` passed all package hash and
  signature checks. Verified the linked ELF imports `sceSystemServiceLoadExec`
  and its native finish routine waits after the request without returning to libc.
- Updated the changelog, consumer troubleshooting and console acceptance tracker.
  No UI layout changed. No live deployment or console retest was performed at
  this stage. The user's subsequent exit-crash confirmation is recorded below.

## Splash, controller hints and PS4 keyboard assignment — 2026-10-16

- Removed the requested splash minimum, including the error-path sleep. The
  dashboard now appears as soon as the initial scan is ready; input during startup
  is still consumed so a held button does not open menus over the splash.
- Replaced written face-button names with drawn Cross, Square, Triangle and Circle
  symbols in keycaps, plus Options and L1/R1 keycaps, beside their action text.
  Dialogs use the same hints and the keyboard guidance describes selecting keys
  and the native Done button rather than suggesting X immediately saves the field.
- User clarified that the PS4 keyboard works, but O selects characters while X
  closes it. Inspection found the generated SFO used ATTRIBUTE=0. The new package
  requests Cross for common dialogs using ATTRIBUTE=2 (without the system-default
  override bit), and includes ATTRIBUTE2=2 as used in current native PS4 packaging.
  The system IME remains in place; no global console button mapping is changed.
- Added a regression running the real metadata staging script and pinned publishing
  tool, then parsing the resulting SFO to check the assignment flags. Startup
  regressions now check that a ready dashboard and startup errors are not held
  behind a three-second timer, while retaining asset-root and cleanup-order checks.
- `make test` passed all host suites (including artwork/font ASan/UBSan) and
  fourteen Python integration tests, including real SFO generation. Successful and
  failed startup both passed the updated no-delay regression checks.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r9.pkg`; `make validate` passed all package hash and
  signature checks. Extracted the package and verified ATTRIBUTE=2, ATTRIBUTE2=2
  and APP_VER=00.09 in its actual SFO, matching the staged metadata.
- Generated fourteen desktop captures and inspected the Available dashboard,
  Settings and URL editor. Updated the library, summary and storage images used
  in the documentation. No live deployment was performed. The corrected native
  keyboard assignment still needs a PS4 retest.

## Missing installed-title icons — 2026-10-16

- User reported that Installed game tiles appear without icons. Discovery searched
  for `icon0.png` beside the SFO that supplied each title. This misses the console's
  split layout: private metadata is in `/system_data/priv/appmeta`, while artwork
  is in `/user/appmeta`. The old scan also omitted the public external subtree.
- Confirmed separate internal/external metadata and icon paths in Itemzflow's
  installed-library implementation. Discovery now accepts independent icon roots,
  searches the public internal/external paths first, and retains metadata-directory
  fallback for co-located layouts. Empty, non-file and unreadable candidates are
  skipped; missing artwork does not remove the title from Installed.
- Added an offline regression that discovers titles from private metadata, resolves
  their separate public icons and loads the actual PNGs through ArtworkCache.
  It covers internal/external titles, duplicate metadata, an empty earlier icon,
  public-icon priority, missing artwork and the co-located fallback under ASan/UBSan.
- `make test` passed all host suites, including the installed-icon regression under
  ASan/UBSan, and fourteen Python integration tests. Internal, external and fallback
  icons loaded through the cache without any configured remote artwork URL.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r10.pkg`; `make validate` passed all package hash and
  signature checks. Generated fourteen desktop captures and inspected Installed
  tiles and the details view using the preview's sample artwork.
- No live deployment or console retest was performed. The reported console symptom
  still needs a retest with r10, including internal/external titles and offline use.

## Reported URL/config save failure — 2026-10-16

- Inspected the configured console's app config and recent app log through FTP,
  read-only. The config already contains a nonempty games URL. Its saved path has
  extra suffix characters and returns HTTP 404; the companion `/games` endpoint
  returns HTTP 200 with 44 entries when checked from Linux. No console file was
  changed and no private target/source addresses or credentials are committed.
- The console log also records `Disable redirects (0x80431001)` before fetching.
  Native HTTP initialization used linked imports, but policy functions came from
  an additional `sceKernelLoadStartModule`/dlsym lookup. That can select separate
  service state. Removed the extra HTTP and SSL loads and bound the verified ABI
  directly to the same imports as initialization. Separate service state is the
  suspected cause of this HTTP error; a PS4 retest is still required.
- Save commands now carry their configuration snapshot rather than selecting a
  draft according to whichever screen is current when the command runs. A successful
  save checks the written settings, logs its destination and leaves Settings open
  with confirmation. Failed saves retain the draft and show an inline error.
- Added guidance distinguishing keyboard acceptance from committing settings,
  plus inline connection status so a failed fetch is visible inside Settings.
- Added tests using the real App/UI/storage pipeline for edit/commit, using the
  saved source, delayed command handling, write failure/retry and restart. Added
  tests of the native HTTP branch against pinned SDK declarations and fake services,
  including rejecting any extra service-module load.
- `make test` passed all host suites, including the new App persistence and native
  HTTP adapter tests, artwork/font ASan/UBSan and fourteen Python integrations.
  The native adapter covers successful streaming, rejecting redirects, size limits,
  cancellation, policy errors, resource cleanup and reuse after a failure.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r12.pkg`; `make validate` passed every package hash
  and signature check. The linked native HTTP object imports the policy/SSL calls
  directly and no longer references module loading or dlsym.
- Generated fourteen desktop captures and inspected Settings with the inline
  connection result, URL, draft/save notice and controller hints all visible.
  r12 supersedes the intermediate r11 build after adding inline connection status.
- Live activity was limited to read-only FTP and HTTP diagnosis. No console file
  was changed, package deployed, or corrected native HTTP behavior retested on PS4.

## Application identity and canonical data directory — 2026-10-16

- Removed inherited branding and unrelated repository references from current
  sources, About, README and packaged credits. Removed the unrelated application
  settings importer and its API argument, rather than hiding or renaming it.
- Console startup now selects `/data/PS4-Game-Installer` after privilege setup.
  The first upgraded launch moves this application's previous data directory as
  a unit when the destination is absent, preserving config, tasks, catalog,
  artwork and logs. An existing destination is never overwritten or merged.
- Added model tests for data preservation, repeated launches, fresh installs,
  destination precedence and rejecting a regular file at the data-directory path.
  Updated App persistence tests to use the simplified settings API.
- Added the canonical storage/identity rule to AGENTS.md. All host suites passed,
  including directory preservation, App persistence, native HTTP, artwork/font
  ASan/UBSan and fourteen Python integrations.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r13.pkg`; `make validate` passed every package hash
  and signature check. Scanned current tracked files, the native ELF and extracted
  package files: no inherited-name references remain.
- Generated fourteen desktop captures and inspected the updated About screen.
  No package was deployed or live console data moved; startup relocation still
  needs a hardware retest.

## Reported game-launch service failure — 2026-10-16

- User reports `Load game launcher: 0x80020002` when selecting an installed game.
  That diagnostic is emitted before resolving or calling the launch function.
  The adapter used an export-library name as a separate system SPRX filename.
- Verified the module/library mapping against the SystemService export table:
  LncUtil functions belong to `libSceSystemService.sprx`. Updated the lookup to
  that module and kept successful handles cached while allowing failed loads
  to retry. No firmware offsets, replacement system files or new stubs are used.
- Initialization errors are checked, including the documented already-initialized
  result. Missing symbols and a missing foreground user now stop before launch
  with readable errors. Launch parameters and positive app-ID success handling
  remain unchanged.
- Added a test of the real native adapter using pinned SDK declarations and fake
  services: only the actual module exists in the fixture. It covers invalid IDs,
  failed load/retry, missing symbols, initialization/user errors, launch failures,
  repeated launches and zero/positive success results.
- `make test` passed all host suites, including the new native launcher test,
  artwork/font ASan/UBSan and fourteen Python integrations.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r14.pkg`; `make validate` passed all package hashes
  and signatures. Inspected the native object/ELF: the adapter uses SystemService
  and the obsolete standalone-module path is absent. The source identity audit
  still passes. No UI behavior changed in this revision.
- No live deployment or game launch has been performed; PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN
  retesting remains unchecked.

## Recurring library-refresh HTTP failure — 2026-10-16

- User again reports `games: Disable redirects (0x80431001)` with the last valid
  library retained. This occurs during request setup, before sending the URL.
  The installed revision was not identified in the report. The r12 binding change
  alone has not established successful hardware refresh.
- Inspected the configured target's HTTP service read-only over FTP and checked
  the exported setters' argument layout. Checked r14's native imports: init,
  template creation and setters have the expected names and library IDs. These
  checks do not prove which runtime instance the running app selected or establish
  the exact cause of this console report. No target files were changed.
- Replaced linked HTTP entry points with a function table resolved from a single
  system HTTP module handle. Init, settings, transfers and destruction all use
  that table. Removed `-lSceHttp` so the application cannot mix HTTP stub imports
  with the resolved client. Failed module loads and symbol lookups remain retryable.
- Redirect rejection, platform certificate verification, DNS/connect/send/receive
  timeouts, cancellation and size limits remain enforced. Setup failures are not
  ignored and existing catalog data remains available after failed refresh.
- Updated native HTTP tests to supply functions only through the resolver. Any
  direct HTTP import in the production adapter now fails to link in that test.
  Added failed module load, missing/null function and retry cases alongside the
  existing successful fetch, policy failure, redirect, cancellation and size tests.
- `make test` passed all host suites, including native HTTP binding/retry,
  native launcher, App persistence, artwork/font ASan/UBSan and fourteen Python
  integrations. Verified all seventeen requested HTTP exports exist in the
  configured target's service module.
- Built `dist/PS4Game_installer-r15.pkg`; `make validate` passed every package hash
  and signature check. The native HTTP object and linked ELF contain no linked
  HTTP entry points. The source identity audit still passes; no UI code changed.
- No package was deployed and the corrected client still needs a PS4 11.00 +
  GoldHEN refresh/artwork retest.

## Controller navigation report — 2026-10-16

- User reports navigation does not work with the controller/manipulator. The
  existing native adapter reads digital buttons only, and the preview ignores
  analog axes. Implemented left-stick navigation while retaining D-pad/buttons.
- Added a shared controller state machine and a native SDK pad-data adapter.
  Native byte axes are centered at 128 and converted to the preview's signed
  axis range. Disconnected/failed reads produce no movement.
- Stick navigation uses activation/release deadzones, dominant-axis selection and
  hysteresis near diagonals. Direction repeat begins after 350 ms, then runs at
  100 ms intervals. D-pad overrides analog input; face/menu buttons do not repeat,
  and each controller sample emits at most one action.
- Closing the keyboard suppresses controls still held until release/centering.
  The preview now owns/closes its controller handle and supports hotplug. Both
  backends route controller input through the same state machine.
- Added tests for native pad samples driving the real tile/summary/sidebar/menu/
  settings/details UI, deadzones/repeat, opposing/simultaneous buttons, disconnect
  recovery and keyboard suppression. The SDL test drives the real preview Video
  adapter with a virtual controller, including detach/reconnect and keyboard exit.
- `make test` passed all host suites, including the new controller suite, native
  HTTP/launcher tests, App persistence, artwork/font ASan/UBSan and fourteen Python
  integrations. The SDL virtual-controller test passed repeat, keyboard return
  and detach/reconnect checks using the real Video adapter.
- `make all` reused the matching `dist/PS4Game_installer-r16.pkg`; `make validate`
  passed all hashes and signatures. The native ELF contains the shared controller
  poll/suppression implementation. The source identity audit passes.
- Generated fourteen desktop captures and inspected Installed tiles and Options.
  No live deployment or hardware navigation success is claimed; PS4 11.00 +
  GoldHEN retesting remains unchecked.

## Exit-crash hardware confirmation — 2026-10-16

- User explicitly confirmed that the exit crash is fixed. Marked the reported
  end-of-app CE-34878-0 issue resolved and updated consumer troubleshooting and
  the changelog to reflect this console evidence.
- The exact installed revision and exit path were not stated. The separate
  startup/runtime error-screen shutdown check remains open; no other console
  acceptance checks were marked complete from this confirmation.
- Documentation-only change: reviewed the diff and ran `git diff --check`.
  No application code, package or revision record changed; no rebuild was needed.

## Confirmed hardware environment — 2026-10-16

- User confirmed the application works on real PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN hardware.
  Updated the README and tracker from a planned hardware target to confirmed
  operation, alongside the previously confirmed exit-crash resolution.
- The installed revision and individual feature results were not specified.
  Detailed acceptance checks remain tracked separately rather than inferring
  launch, installation or other feature results from this general confirmation.
- Documentation-only update; `git diff --check` passed. No application changes,
  rebuild or package revision increment.

## Keyboard and settings-save confirmation — 2026-10-16

- User confirmed the PS4 keyboard now works correctly for entering the source URL
  and confirmed saving also works. Recorded both checks as complete for the
  previously confirmed PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN environment, and updated README and
  changelog status.
- Removed the stale pending keyboard-entry check. Cancellation, saved settings
  after restart/refresh and the separate catalog-download check remain tracked
  independently; those outcomes were not specified in this confirmation.
- Documentation-only update; `git diff --check` passed. No rebuild or package
  revision increment was needed.
