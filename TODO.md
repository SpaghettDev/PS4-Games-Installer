# Work tracker

## Documentation: consumer guide and reference manuals

- [x] Shorten README to program description, setup and everyday consumer usage.
- [x] Move detailed configuration/recovery guidance to EXPERT.md.
- [x] Move build/deploy/testing/release guidance to DEVELOPMENT.md.
- [x] Show all supplied Screenshots/ captures as linked 30%-width thumbnails.
- [x] Validate links, gallery markup, JSON examples and unchanged package inputs.
- [x] Update progress/changelog and commit documentation without a package revision.

## Current implementation: r34 launch regression rollback

- [x] Record the reported r33 console crash when launching a game.
- [x] Restore the exact r32 native launch adapter and regression-test expectations.
- [x] Keep r32 verification fixes and the revised consumer/expert/development manuals.
- [x] Run launcher/uninstall/session regressions and build/validate r34.
- [x] Commit the successful revision and updated progress/changelog.
- [ ] Retest r34 on PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN: accept the normal close-installer dialog,
  launch the game without crashing the console, then reopen at the saved selection.

## Current implementation: r32 verification and launch recovery

- [x] Inspect current queue/log evidence and external installed SFO through read-only FTP.
- [x] Confirm completed base packages with fresh installed Title ID despite catalog version differences.

- [x] Allow Installed launch while a released task only awaits verification.
- [x] Complete relevant host regressions, native build/validation and visual review.
- [x] Update documentation and commit the successful revision.
- [ ] Retest r32 on PS4: Bonfire Peaks resolves to Completed/Installed on startup
  or refresh and X launches it; fresh installs and task cancellation still work.
- [ ] Retest an update whose installed version is below the expected update version;
  it must not be confirmed just because its base title exists.

## Current implementation: r28 reporting and queue actions

- [x] Restore r28 completion verification, progress labels and saved-history behavior.
- [x] Keep r29 wrapping, r30 menu scrollbars and Options-only Downloads/Collections.

- [x] Clear pending cancellation when a concurrent poll releases its task.
- [x] Complete host regressions, native build/validation, screenshot review and docs.
- [x] Commit the completed r31 change.
- [ ] Retest r31 on PS4: cancel a waiting item, direct transfer and native task;
  confirm cancellation failure keeps ownership, retry works, and O keeps the task.
- [ ] Retest r31: remove a historical Failed/Completed/Cancelled entry, restart,
  and confirm installed games/local records/saved packages remain intact.
- [ ] Retest retained menu overflow, wrap boundaries and sidebar migration.
  Fresh r28 installs are already confirmed; no automatic history repair is included.

## Current implementation: wraparound navigation

- [x] Share Up/Down wrapping across all selectable menus and the sidebar.
- [x] Wrap Summary lists and tile rows while preserving sidebar access.
- [x] Cover menu boundaries, shrinking/empty lists, ragged grids and native stick input.
- [x] Complete host tests, native package validation, screenshots and local commit.

  PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN, 2026-10-16).
- [ ] Separately verify r28's active-task preservation, resumed/changed task

- [ ] Complete the individual console acceptance checks below.

## Console acceptance checks

- [ ] Retest r24: a PS4-managed remote transfer changes Downloading → Installing → Verifying → Completed; staged local copying stays Installing.
- [ ] Retest r23: enqueue several packages, monitor stages, retry failures and restore queue state after closing/reopening.
- [ ] Retest r23: cancel a waiting transfer, a direct transfer and an owned BGFT task; cancellation failure keeps ownership/staging.
- [ ] Retest r23: a completed transfer without the title/version stays unconfirmed; actual installation is confirmed by a fresh scan.
- [ ] Retest r23: export to ordinary USB, disconnect/reconnect, restore a valid backup and inspect the pre-restore recovery copy.
- [ ] Retest r23: bulk category/add/remove/clear tags in both libraries, including cancellation and failed-save retry.
- [ ] Retest r23: create/edit/delete saved rules, restart and verify rating, launch and installed-status filters.
- [ ] Retest r23: base/update/DLC grouping, version comparison, package details and O back navigation.
- [ ] Retest r23: source helper with a valid/empty catalog, HTML/404/unreachable source and PS4 IME; use/save only the tested URL.
- [ ] Retest r22: Triangle > Assign category with X; Assign tags with X toggles / Square save, in both libraries.
- [ ] Retest r22: create names through IME, cancel with O, retry a failed write and scroll all game actions.
- [ ] Retest r21: use PS4 IME for category, label, tags and description from both libraries.
- [ ] Retest r21: save, refresh/restart and uninstall; personal metadata stays by Title ID.
- [ ] Retest r21: browse/filter/group local categories and tags, including names with no assigned games.
- [ ] Retest r21: rename/delete a category/tag; assignments update, notes/ratings/history remain.
- [ ] Retest r21: cancel an edit and retry a failed save without losing the draft.
- [x] Initial console launch reaches the splash and readable startup-error screen
  (user report, 2026-10-16; failed opening the icon in the previous build).
- [x] PS4 keyboard opens and correctly accepts source URL input (user confirmation,
  2026-10-16, PS4 11.00 + GoldHEN).
- [x] Saving the source URL/settings works on the console (user confirmation, 2026-10-16).
- [x] Console shows Installed game tiles and names (user report, 2026-10-16;
  icons were missing in the previous package).
- [x] Read-only FTP check confirmed a saved games URL before the data-directory
  correction (2026-10-16).
- [ ] Retest r13: data moves to `/data/PS4-Game-Installer`, settings and caches are
  preserved, and About displays only the current application's identity.
- [ ] Verify the saved source/settings survive app restart and library refresh,
  and the config-file confirmation is displayed.
- [x] r16 FTP log shows 44 packages loaded/refreshed and a successful connection
  test; user confirms remote artwork downloads work (2026-10-16).
- [ ] Retest r27: L2/R2 pages both layouts without unintended repeats; Square on
  sidebar opens the letter picker, including filtered/grouped and empty views.
- [ ] Retest r27: PS4 search keyboard cancellation, recent reuse, history clearing
  and restart persistence; O returns from the new dialogs correctly.
- [ ] Retest r27: create/rename/delete/switch profiles, explicit Save/discard,
  offline cache isolation and switching while a catalog request/transfer runs.
- [ ] Retest r30: Downloads/Collections open from Options and O returns there;
  the three library sidebar entries wrap correctly. Retest Updates and selected
  game after launch/reopen; filters and both sort directions work.
- [ ] Retest r25: missing-base update/DLC is blocked; queued base completes and
  verifies before dependents; cancelling/failing the base explains dependent failure.
- [ ] Retest r25: staging/artwork sizes match the console; cleanup confirmation
  preserves active and unknown files, removes released/partial files, and refreshes usage.
- [ ] Retest r25: USB diagnostic export/readback, disconnect/read-only recovery,
  and absence of private URLs/credentials; report opens on a desktop.

  artwork (user confirmation, 2026-10-16).

- [ ] Retest r19: rate 1–5 stars, refresh/restart and confirm ratings remain by Title ID.
- [x] Uninstall removes games successfully (user confirmation and FTP log, 2026-10-16).

  after restart; those outcomes were not specified in the confirmation.

  task 268435469 / 0x80991404; user confirms installation works after r28
  (2026-10-16). No post-fix task log was collected for internal-state verification.
- [ ] Retest r20: Retry reuses the complete staged file, and a persistent dialog
  shows an actual registration error if the system still refuses the request.
- [ ] Storage panel detects a PS4 Extended Storage drive and updates after disconnect.
- [ ] Install to each PS4 system destination and verify the resulting game location.
- [ ] Retest r17: X in Installation destination changes the selected PS4 default;
  disconnect Extended Storage and verify the unavailable drive cannot be selected.
- [ ] Continue large-package/repeated-transfer stability checks after r19's stack repair;
  no r17 crash dump was available to establish its exact fault.
- [ ] Retest r19: internal/external capacities are correct, including disconnect and full/unknown states.
- [ ] Clear failed r16 downloads once, then install through the direct fallback,
  observe progress, retry an error, and verify staging cleanup.
- [ ] Returning/restarting refreshes installed state and reconciles tracked tasks.
